Exercise 2.38: Describe the differences in type deduction between decltype and
auto. Give an example of an expression where auto and decltype will deduce
the same type and an example where they will deduce differing types.

When one uses an int both types will be the same
int i = 6;
auto a = i; // int
decltype(i) b = a; //int

When one uses a reference types will be different

int i = 6, &j = i;
auto a = j // int
decltype(j) b = j // int&
