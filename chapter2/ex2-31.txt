Exercise 2.31: Given the declarations in the previous exercise determine whether the
following assignments are legal. Explain how the top-level or low-level const applies
in each case.
r1 = v2; // Legal
p1 = p2; // Legal
p1 = p3; // Legal because can be changed to const int.
p2 = p1; // Illegal, can't change const
p2 = p3; // Legal because can assign to pointer
