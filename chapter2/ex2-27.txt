Exercise 2.27: Which of the following initializations are legal? Explain why.
(a) int i = -1, &r = 0;
(b) int *const p2 = &i2;
(c) const int i = -1, &r = 0;
(d) const int *const p3 = &i2;
(e) const int *p1 = &i2;
(f) const int &const r2;
(g) const int i2 = i, &r = i;

a. &r can't reference a temporary value.
b. It's legal if ie is a int.
c. It's legal because 0 becomes a constant permanent value.
d. i2 has to be a const int.
e. i2 has to be an int.
f. It's illegal. There can't be a const reference.
g. It works if i is defined.
