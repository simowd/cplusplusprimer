Exercise 2.16: Which, if any, of the following assignments are invalid? If they are
valid, explain what they do.
int i = 0, &r1 = i; double d = 0, &r2 = d;
(a) r2 = 3.14159;
(b) r2 = r1;
(c) i = r2;
(d) r1 = d;

a. It's valid. d changes to the value 3.14159.
b. It's valid. r2 now references to r1 value.
c. It's valid. i value changes to 0.
d. It's valid. r1 now references d.
