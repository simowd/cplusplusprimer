Exercise 2.29: Using the variables in the previous exercise, which of the following as-
signments are legal? Explain why.
(a) i = ic;
(b) p1 = p3;
(c) p1 = &ic;
(d) p3 = &ic;
(e) p2 = p1;
(f) ic = *p3;

a. It's legal, int becomes const int.
b. It's legal because it's an int.
c. It's legal because it's an int.
d. It's legal because it's a reference to a const int.
e. It doesn't work because p1 is not a const* int.
f. It's illegal because you can't define a const int.
