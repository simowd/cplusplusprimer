Exercise 2.30: For each of the following declarations indicate whether the object being
declared has top-level or low-level const.
const int v2 = 0; // top-level
int v1 = v2; // not a const.
int *p1 = &v1, &r1 = v1; //low-level
const int *p2 = &v2 //top-level, *const p3 = &i //low level, &r2 = v2 //top-level;
