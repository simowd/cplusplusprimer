Exercise 2.9: Explain the following definitions. For those that are illegal, explain
whatâ€™s wrong and how to correct it.
(a) std::cin >> int input_value;
(b) int i = { 3.14 };
(c) double salary = wage = 9999.99;
(d) int i = 3.14;

a. It's an illegal definition, the declaration of a variable shouldn't be part of the input
b. It ends in an error. To make it work, one should avoid list initialization.
c. wage should be defined before assigning it to salary.
d. 3.14 gets rounded to 3 and gets initialized.
