Exercise 3.37: What does the following program do?
const char ca[] = {’h’, ’e’, ’l’, ’l’, ’o’};
const char *cp = ca;
while (*cp) {
    cout << *cp << endl;
    ++cp;
}

An array in initialized, then a pointer is built.
Inside the while loop, the pointer is printed and then it jumps to the next character by
adding one to the pointer arithmetic.
