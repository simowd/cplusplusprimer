Exercise 3.30: Identify the indexing errors in the following code:
constexpr size_t array_size = 10;
int ia[array_size];
for (size_t ix = 1; ix <= array_size; ++ix)
    ia[ix] = ix;

The error is on the for loop. it goes until the size of the array, which is 10.
However the index can only reach the index of 9.
