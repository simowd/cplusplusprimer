Exercise 3.27: Assuming txt_size is a function that takes no arguments and returns
an int value, which of the following definitions are illegal? Explain why.
unsigned buf_size = 1024;
(a) int ia[buf_size];
(b) int ia[4 * 7 - 14];
(c) int ia[txt_size()];
(d) char st[11] = "fundamental";

a. OK
b. OK
c. OK
d. Error. There's no space for the null at the end of the string literal.
