Exercise 4.19: Given that ptr points to an int, that vec is a vector<int>, and that
ival is an int, explain the behavior of each of these expressions. Which, if any, are
likely to be incorrect? Why? How might each be corrected?
(a) ptr != 0 && *ptr++
(b) ival++ && ival
(c) vec[ival++] <= vec[ival]

a. It works.
b. It works.
c. It works.
