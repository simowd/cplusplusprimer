Exercise 4.16: Although the following are legal, they probably do not behave as the
programmer expects. Why? Rewrite the expressions as you think they should be.
(a) if (p = getPtr() != 0)
(b) if (i = 1024)

a. Deleting the assignment will make it behave properly.
b. Adding a second = sign will make it check if it is equal to 1024.
